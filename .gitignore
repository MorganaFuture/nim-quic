# Ignore all test build files in tests folder (auto generated when running tests).
# First rule (`tests/**/test*[^.]*`) will ignore all binaries: has prefix test +  does not have dot in name.
# Second rule is here to un-ignores all files with extension,
# because it appears that vs code is skipping text search is some tests files without these rules.
